# Persistent Counter (Flutter Web)

A minimal Flutter 3 Material 3 counter application for the web. The app
features a dark interface with a large counter, a "+1" button, and a reset
button. Counter values are saved with `shared_preferences` so refreshing the
page keeps the latest total.

## Running the app

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

The UI automatically adapts to desktop and mobile layouts.
